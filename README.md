## Inspiration
In the current situation, small shops have to limit how many clients are allowed at the same time. In Geneva for instance shops are now limited to one customer every 10m<sup>2</sup>.

## What it does
Our app allows shop owners to offer their clients the possibility to reserve a time slot where they can come and shop without having to queue while respecting the latest safety restrictions about Covid-19.

## How we built it
We built our project using _MySQL_, _Sails.js_ and _React_.

## Challenges we ran into
Waking up at 8 was a real challenge for some of us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our team and how fast we were able to bring our solution to life.

## What we learned
We all learned something during this hackathon, whether it's _Sails.js_ or video making for the presentation. Everyone had something to give and teach the others.

## What's next for ShopSafe
ShopSafe still has a long way to go. We need to find shop partners and to advertise our app. We also need to iterate on our solution and make it better: the fact that we're proud of our app today doesn't mean it's ready to use !
